# The Odin Project - Odin Recipes

It’s time to put all of the HTML knowledge you have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished.

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

Proud of the following codes:

HTML: TBA

<!-- ```html
<div class="plan-box">
  <div class="plan-box-left">
    <img src="./images/icon-music.svg" alt="icon-music" />
    <div class="plan-details">
      <h2>Annual Plan</h2>
      <p>$59.99/year</p>
    </div>

``` -->

CSS: TBA

<!-- ```css
:root {
  /* primary colors */
  --primary-pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
